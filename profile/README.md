#  Courtroom Simulator 👋

The Courtroom Simulator is an application designed to emulate courtroom trial scenarios, aiding users in practicing the process of courtroom debate. Artificial intelligence agents will play the roles of the judge and the opposing attorney, with the judge rendering a verdict based on the user's performance during the trial. Users will be rewarded with more tokens if they win the case, and a smaller amount of tokens if they lose.
